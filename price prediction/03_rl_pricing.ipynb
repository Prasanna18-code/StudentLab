This is the likely reason why the log files were either not created or not fully written to disk. The current code block for loading the logs uses the correct paths based on how `stable-baselines3` saves these files by default (for `monitor.csv`) and via the `EvalCallback`'s `log_path` parameter (for `evaluations.npz`). Therefore, the code itself is logically correct for *attempting* to load the logs, but the files simply do not exist in the environment. The fix is to provide the correct code block again, but emphasize that the training process needs to be completed successfully to generate these files.\n",
